# Automating CI/CD Pipelines using Jenkins and Docker for Seamless Deployments

This project demonstrates how to set up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. The pipeline automates code build, test, and deployment processes to streamline software delivery.

## Features

- **Automated Builds** triggered by code changes (e.g., GitHub Webhooks)
- **Dockerized Jenkins** for easy setup and portability
- **Docker Images** for application and Jenkins agents
- **Deployment Automation** to staging or production environments
- **Pipeline-as-Code** using Jenkinsfile
- **Scalable Architecture** with Docker Compose (optional)

## Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- Basic knowledge of Jenkins Pipelines and Docker

## Project Structure

```bash
.
├── Jenkinsfile               # Declarative pipeline definition
├── docker-compose.yml        # Multi-container setup for Jenkins and the app
├── jenkins/
│   └── Dockerfile            # Custom Jenkins image
├── app/
│   ├── Dockerfile            # Dockerfile for your application
│   └── (source code)         # Application source code
└── README.md
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ci-cd-jenkins-docker.git
cd ci-cd-jenkins-docker
2. Start Jenkins and Application Containers
bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up -d
3. Access Jenkins
Visit http://localhost:8080 and follow the setup wizard.

To get the admin password:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
4. Configure Your Pipeline
Install required plugins (Pipeline, Git, Docker, etc.)

Create a new pipeline project

Point Jenkins to this repository and use the Jenkinsfile

Jenkinsfile Overview
Stages: Checkout → Build → Test → Dockerize → Deploy

Post Actions: Notifications, Cleanup

Customization
Modify Jenkinsfile to match your build/test/deploy logic

Use environment-specific Docker Compose files if needed
